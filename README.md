This project entails using CNN models to classify breast cancer images. Five pre-trained CNN models were utilised, with a proposed CNN model that was built from scratch. 
The pre-trained models used include LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet50 and VGG16

The dataset used is unbalanced, with benign images much more than the malignant and normal images.
To show the effect of unbalance dataset on CNN models, the models were fitted on the raw dataset, and also fitted after balancing the dataset.

The result shows a significant increament in the recall, and the overall accuracy score compared to when the dataset was unbalance.
